### The details
Hacker News is YCombinator's news website focusing on CS and entrepreneurship. It
has an open-source API.
The task is to query the top 10 stories and their comments and display them on a view.
You can keep the implementation as light or detail-oriented as you would like.

### What we're looking for
We're looking for a full-stack Ruby on Rails implementation of a view that displays the
top 10 HackerNews stories. At a minimum, here’s what the implementation should have:
View, Controller and Database. Bonus points for Turbo and Stimulus
implementations here!
Treat the API integration with some pessimism. It’s bound to throw errors at random
times; your system gets rate-limited etc.
A background job that downloads stories and comments once every hour
The deliverable would be a GitHub repository. You can either keep it public and share

the link with us or invite our GitHub accounts to it. The usernames are neshay and Sub-
Xaero .

We're intentionally keeping the details light as we want you to have the freedom in
implementation. That said, please don't hesitate to ask any questions or clarifications.
